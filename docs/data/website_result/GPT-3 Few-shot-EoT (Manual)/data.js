It is known that the number of 37 cents stamps plus twice the number of 20 cents stamps equals three times the number of 50 cents stamps plus 7. The number of 37 cents stamps plus the number of 20 cents stamps plus the number of 50 cents stamps equals four times the number of 30 cents stamps plus 5.

Let's start by solving the system of linear equations for the last question.\n\nQuestion: Four numbers have a sum of 88. The smallest number is 5 less than the second smallest number, the second smallest number is 10 less than the third smallest number, and the third smallest number is 21 less than the largest number. Find the four numbers.\n\nSystem of linear equations:\n\nLet's assume the four numbers are a, b, c, and d.\n\n1. a + b + c + d = 88\n2. a = b - 5\n3. b = c - 10\n4. c = d - 21\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations to find the values of a, b, c, and d. Let's start by substituting the expressions from equations 2, 3, and 4 into equation 1.\n\na + (a + 5) + (a + 15) + (a + 36) = 88\n4a + 56 = 88\n4a = 88 - 56\n4a = 32\na = 8\n\nNow that we have found the value of a, we can find the values of b, c, and d using the relationships given in the system of linear equations.\n\nb = a + 5\nb = 8 + 5\nb = 13\n\nc = b + 10\nc = 13 + 10\nc = 23\n\nd = c + 21\nd = 23 + 21\nd = 44\n\nSo, the four numbers are 8, 13, 23, and 44.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
