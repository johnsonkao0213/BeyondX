        "response": "First, let's represent the son's age as \"S\". \n\nWe know that the dad is 4 times older than the son, so the dad's age is 4S. The difference in their ages is 27 years, so we can set up the equation 4S - S = 27 to find the son's age.\n\nSolving the equation, we get S = 9. So, the son is 9 years old.\n\nNow, we can find the dad's age by substituting S = 9 into the equation 4S. The dad is 4 * 9 = 36 years old.\n\nThe mom is 3 times older than the son, so the mom's age is 3S. Substituting S = 9, we find that the mom is 3 * 9 = 27 years old.\n\nThe grandparent is twice as old as the dad, so the grandparent's age is 2 * 36 = 72 years old.\n\nThe aunt is 5 years younger than the mom, so the aunt's age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\nSo, the son is 9 years old, the dad is 36 years old, the mom is 27 years old, the grandparent is 72 years old, and the aunt is 22 years old."

P + C + A + W + E = 100 (total pounds of the mix)\n2. P * 2.40 + C * 6.00 + A * 4.00 + W * 5.00 + E * 7.00 = 100 * 3.80 (total cost of the mix)\n3. P + C = 3A (amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews equals three times the amount of almonds)\n4. P + C + A = 4W + 40 (amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews plus the amount of almonds equals four times the amount of walnuts plus 40 pounds)\n5. P + C + A + W = 5E + 40 (amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews plus the amount of almonds plus the amount of walnuts equals five times the amount of pecans plus 40 pounds)\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the amounts of each type of nut. Let's start by solving equation 3 for P and C in terms of A, and then substitute those expressions into equations 4 and 5."

Let's call the first number x, the second number y, the third number z, the fourth number w, and the fifth number v. Then we can use the given information to form equations and solve for the values of x, y, z, w, and v. Let's start with the first equation: \"Three times the first number minus the second number plus the third number plus the fourth number plus half the fifth number is 45.\" We can write this as:\n\n3x - y + z + w + 0.5v = 45\n\nNow, let's move on to the second equation and continue from there."

We can call them a, b, c, d, and e.\n\nWe know that the sum of the five numbers is 64, so we can write the equation:\na + b + c + d + e = 64\n\nWe also know the relationships between the numbers based on the given information. Let's use these relationships to form additional equations.\n\nThe first number is 33 less than twice the second number:\na = 2b - 33\n\nThe second number is 9 more than twice the third number:\nb = 2c + 9\n\nThe fourth number is 15 less than the sum of the first and third numbers:\nd = a + c - 15\n\nThe fifth number is 10 less than the second number:\ne = b - 10\n\nNow we have a system of equations. We can solve for the values of a, b, c, d, and e by substituting and solving the equations. Let's start with the first equation and then substitute the values into the other equations to find the values of the numbers."
