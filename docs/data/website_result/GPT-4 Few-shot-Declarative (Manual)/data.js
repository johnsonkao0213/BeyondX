The correct equation for s should be:\n[[eq s = (3g - 24) / 3]]\nWhich simplifies to:\n[[eq s = g - 8]]\n\nLet's substitute the correct equation for s into equation 2 and solve again:\n[[eq g + (2g - 16) + (2(2g - 16) - 40 - g) + (g - 8) = 100]]\nSimplifying, we get:\n[[eq g + 2g - 16 + 4g - 32 - 40 - g + g - 8 = 100]]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n[[eq 6g - 96 = 100]]\nAdding 96 to both sides, we get:\n[[eq 6g = 196]]\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n[[eq g = 196 / 6]]\nSimplifying, we get:\n[[eq g = 32.666...]]\n\nSince we still do not have a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our equations and solve the system correctly.\n\nLet's start over with the correct system of equations:\n\n1. [[eq b = 2g - 16]]\n2. [[eq g + b + t + s = 100]]\n3. [[eq g + t = 2b - 40]]\n4. [[eq g + b = 3s + 8]]\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express b in terms of g: [[eq b = 2g - 16]].\nSubstituting b into equation 3, we get: [[eq g + t = 2(2g - 16) - 40]], which simplifies to [[eq g + t = 4g - 72]].\nFrom this, we can express t in terms of g: [[eq t = 3g - 72]].\n\nSubstituting b and t into equation 2, we get:\n[[eq g + (2g - 16) + (3g - 72) + s = 100]]\nSimplifying, we get:\n[[eq 6g - 88 + s = 100]]\nFrom this, we can express s in terms of g: [[eq s = 100 - 6g + 88]]\nSimplifying, we get:\n[[eq s = 188 - 6g]]\n\nNow we substitute b and s into equation 4:\n[[eq g + (2g - 16) = 3(188 - 6g) + 8]]\nSimplifying, we get:\n[[eq 3g - 16 = 564 - 18g + 8]]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n[[eq 21g = 588]]\nDividing both sides by 21, we get:\n[[eq g = 28]]\n\nNow we can find b, t, and s using the values of g:\n[[eq b = 2g - 16]]\n[[eq b = 2(28) - 16]]\n[[eq b = 56 - 16]]\n[[eq b = 40]]\n\n[[eq t = 3g - 72]]\n[[eq t = 3(28) - 72]]\n[[eq t = 84 - 72]]\n[[eq t = 12]]\n\n[[eq s = 188 - 6g]]\n[[eq s = 188 - 6(28)]]\n[[eq s = 188 - 168]]\n[[eq s = 20]]\n\nThe answer is the values of g, b, t, and s [[answer g, b, t, s]]."
