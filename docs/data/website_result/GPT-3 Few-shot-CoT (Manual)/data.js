This gives us the equation 0.20x + 0.70y + 0.30z = 115.\n3. The given relationship between the amounts of the different solutions: 2x + y = 5z + 30.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation 2x + y = 5z + 30 for y:\ny = 5z + 30 - 2x.\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the equation x + y + z = 250:\nx + (5z + 30 - 2x) + z = 250,\n-x + 6z + 30 = 250,\n6z - x = 220.\n\nNext, we can substitute the expression for y into the equation 0.20x + 0.70y + 0.30z = 115:\n0.20x + 0.70(5z + 30 - 2x) + 0.30z = 115,\n0.20x + 3.5z + 21 - 1.4x + 0.30z = 115,\n-1.2x + 3.8z + 21 = 115,\n-1.2x + 3.8z = 94.\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n-1.2x + 3.8z = 94,\n6z - x = 220.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and z. Let's solve for x in the second equation:\nx = 6z - 220.\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n-1.2(6z - 220) + 3.8z = 94,\n-7.2z + 264 + 3.8z = 94,\n-3.4z + 264 = 94,\n-3.4z = -170,\nz = 50.\n\nNow that we have found the value of z, we can substitute it back into the equation x = 6z - 220 to find the value of x:\nx = 6(50) - 220,\nx = 300 - 220,\nx = 80.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of y using the equation y = 5z + 30 - 2x:\ny = 5(50) + 30 - 2(80),\ny = 250 + 30 - 160,\ny = 120.\n\nSo, the solution is:\nx = 80 liters of the 20% solution,\ny = 120 liters of the 70% solution,\nz = 50 liters of the 30% solution."

The father is currently twice as old as his daughter: F = 2D.\n2. Ten years ago, the father was three times as old as the daughter: F - 10 = 3(D - 10).\n3.

The dad is 4 times older than the son, so D = 4S.\n2. The difference in their ages is 27 years, so D - S = 27.\n3. The mom is 3 times older than the son, so M = 3S.\n4. The grandparent is twice as old as the dad, so G = 2D.\n5. The aunt is 5 years younger than the mom, so A = M - 5.\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the ages.\n\nFirst, we can use the equation D = 4S and substitute it into the equation D - S = 27:\n4S - S = 27\n3S = 27\nS = 9\n\nSo, the son is 9 years old.\n\nNow we can find the dad's age using D = 4S:\nD = 4 * 9\nD = 36\n\nSo, the dad is 36 years old.\n\nWe can find the mom's age using M = 3S:\nM = 3 * 9\nM = 27\n\nSo, the mom is 27 years old.\n\nWe can find the grandparent's age using G = 2D:\nG = 2 * 36\nG = 72\n\nSo, the grandparent is 72 years old.\n\nFinally, we can find the aunt's age using A = M - 5:\nA = 27 - 5\nA = 22\n\nSo, the aunt is 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, the son is 9 years old, the dad is 36 years old, the mom is 27 years old, the grandparent is 72 years old, and the aunt is 22 years old."

Let's use the variables p, c, a, w, and e to represent the pounds of peanuts, cashews, almonds, walnuts, and pecans, respectively.\n\nWe have the following information:\n1. The total weight of the mix is 100 pounds: p + c + a + w + e = 100\n2. The cost per pound of the mix is $3.80: (2.40p + 6.00c + 4.00a + 5.00w + 7.00e) / 100 = 3.80\n3. The amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews equals three times the amount of almonds: p + c = 3a\n4. The amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews plus the amount of almonds equals four times the amount of walnuts plus 40 pounds: p + c + a = 4w + 40\n5. The amount of peanuts plus the amount of cashews plus the amount of almonds plus the amount of walnuts equals five times the amount of pecans plus 40 pounds: p + c + a + w = 5e + 40\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of p, c, a, w, and e.
