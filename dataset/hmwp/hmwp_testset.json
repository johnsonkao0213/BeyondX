Therefore, how much should this user pay for gas fees in April?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total gas consumption and then determine the corresponding fee. \n\nLet's assume the total gas consumption in April for this user is X m^3. \n\nIf X is less than or equal to 60m^3, the fee can be calculated as follows: \nFee = X * 0.8 yuan per cubic meter. \n\nIf X is greater than 60m^3, the fee can be calculated as follows: \nFee = (60 * 0.8) + (X - 60) * 1.2 yuan. \n\nSince the average gas fee for this user in April is 0.96 yuan per cubic meter, we can set up the following equation: \n(60 * 0.8) + (X - 60) * 1.2 = X * 0.96. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n48 + 1.2X - 72 = 0.96X. \n\nCombining like terms, we have: \n0.24X = 24. \n\nDividing both sides by 0.24, we find: \nX = 100. \n\nTherefore, the total gas consumption for this user in April is 100m^3. \n\nNow, let's calculate the gas fee: \nIf X is less than or equal to 60m^3, the fee is: \nFee = 100 * 0.8 = 80 yuan. \n\nIf X is greater than 60m^3, the fee is: \nFee = (60 * 0.8) + (100 - 60) * 1.2 = 48 + 48 = 96 yuan. \n\nSince the total gas consumption in April for this user is 100m^3, the gas fee they should pay is 96 yuan."}, {"id": 15548712, "original_text": "\u8f6e\u8239\u4ece\u7532\u5730\u987a\u6c34\u5f00\u5f80\u4e59\u5730\uff0c\u6240\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4ece\u4e59\u5730\u9006\u6c34\u5f00\u5f80\u7532\u5730\u5c111.5\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0e\u5df2\u77e5\u8239\u5728\u9759\u6c34\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a18\u5343\u7c73/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6c34\u6d41\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a2\u5343\u7c73/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u7532\u3001\u4e592\u5730\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a\u591a\u5c11\u5343\u7c73\uff0e", "equation": "x / ( 18.0 + 2.0 ) + 1.5 = x / ( 18.0 - 2.0 )", "ans": [120], "new_text": "The ship travels downstream from point A to point B, and it takes 1.5 hours less time than traveling upstream from point B to point A.
