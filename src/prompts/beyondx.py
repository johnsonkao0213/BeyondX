z = 100
w = 50

Problem:
At a local event, tickets are sold at different prices: 4 dollars for students, 6 dollars for general admission, 3 dollars for seniors, and 2 dollars for children. In total, 675 tickets were sold, collecting 3276 dollars. It is known that twice the number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus half the number of senior tickets plus half the number of child tickets equals 737. The number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus the number of senior tickets plus twice the number of child tickets equals 725. How many student, general admission, senior, and child tickets were sold?

Step 1: Variable Meaning
x = number of student tickets sold
y = number of general admission tickets sold
z = number of senior tickets sold
w = number of child tickets sold

Step 2: Introduce a New Variable
Let's introduce a new variable, v, which represents the number of VIP tickets sold. Let's say that 50 VIP tickets were sold.

x = 137
y = 388
z = 100
w = 50
v = 50

Step 3: Add New Terms and Equations
We can add the new variable to the existing equations and create a new equation. The new system of equations becomes:

4.0 * x + 6.0 * y + 3.0 * z + 2.0 * w + 10.0 * v = 3776.0
x + y + z + w + v = 725.0
2.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 0.5 * z + 0.5 * w + 0.5 * v = 762.0
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 1.0 * z + 2.0 * w + 1.0 * v = 775.0
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 1.0 * z + 1.0 * w + 2.0 * v = 775.0

Step 4: Introduce New Statements
We can introduce new statements related to the new variable. For example, we can say that the total revenue collected from selling all types of tickets, including VIP tickets at 10 dollars each, was 3776 dollars. The total number of tickets sold, including VIP tickets, was 725. Twice the number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus half the number of senior tickets plus half the number of child tickets plus half the number of VIP tickets equals 762. The number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus the number of senior tickets plus twice the number of child tickets plus the number of VIP tickets equals 775. The number of each type of ticket plus twice the number of VIP tickets equals 775.

Step 5: Formulate the New Problem
At a local event, tickets are sold at different prices: 4 dollars for students, 6 dollars for general admission, 3 dollars for seniors, 2 dollars for children, and 10 dollars for VIPs. In total, 725 tickets were sold, collecting 3776 dollars. It is known that twice the number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus half the number of senior tickets plus half the number of child tickets plus half the number of VIP tickets equals 762. The number of student tickets plus the number of general admission tickets plus the number of senior tickets plus twice the number of child tickets plus the number of VIP tickets equals 775. The number of each type of ticket plus twice the number of VIP tickets equals 775. How many student, general admission, senior, child, and VIP tickets were sold?

We can introduce new statements related to the new variable. For example, we can say that including the administrators, there are 147 people in total. The number of boys, girls, and teachers combined is seven times the number of administrators.

Step 5: Formulate the New Problem
In a school, the ratio of boys to girls is 9 to 4. Including the teachers, staff, and administrators, there are 147 people in total. The ratio of boys to teachers is 9 to 2. The number of boys and girls combined is three times the number of staff members. The number of boys, girls, and teachers combined is seven times the number of administrators. How many boys, girls, teachers, staff members, and administrators are there in the school?

Also, the sum of the first part and the second part equals four times the third part. The sum of the first part, the second part, and the third part equals six times the fourth part. The sum of the first part, the second part, the third part, and the fourth part equals five times the fifth part. Find each part.


System of Equations:
6.0 * 0.01 * x + 9.0 * 0.01 * y + 4.0 * 0.01 * z + 3.0 * 0.01 * w = 824.0
x + y + z + w = 14000.0
x + y = 5.0 * z
x + y + z = 6.0 * w

Solution of System of Equations:
x = 7200

Problem:
Suppose you invested 14,000 dollars in four different ways: part at 6 % annual interest, part at 9 % annual interest, part at 4 % annual interest, and the rest at 3 % annual interest. After one year, you received 824 dollars in interest. Also, the amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest equals five times the amount invested at 4% annual interest. The amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest plus the amount invested at 4% annual interest equals six times the amount invested at 3% annual interest. How much did you invest at each rate?

Step 1: Variable Meaning
x = amount invested at 6% annual interest
y = amount invested at 9% annual interest
z = amount invested at 4% annual interest
w = amount invested at 3% annual interest

Step 2: Introduce a New Variable
Let's introduce a new variable, v, which represents the amount invested at 2% annual interest. Let's say that the amount invested at 2% annual interest is 2000 dollars.

x = 7200
y = 2800
z = 2000
w = 2000
v = 2000

Step 3: Add New Terms and Equations

x + y + z + w + v = 16000.0
x + y = 5.0 * z
x + y + z = 6.0 * w
x + y + z + w = 7.0 * v

Step 4: Introduce New Statements
We can introduce new statements related to the new variable. For example, we can say that you invested 16,000 dollars in five different ways. After one year, you received 864 dollars in interest. Also, the amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest plus the amount invested at 4% annual interest plus the amount invested at 3% annual interest equals seven times the amount invested at 2% annual interest.

Step 5: Formulate the New Problem

After one year, you received 864 dollars in interest. Also, the amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest equals five times the amount invested at 4% annual interest. The amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest plus the amount invested at 4% annual interest equals six times the amount invested at 3% annual interest. The amount invested at 6% annual interest plus the amount invested at 9% annual interest plus the amount invested at 4% annual interest plus the amount invested at 3% annual interest equals seven times the amount invested at 2% annual interest. How much did you invest at each rate?
